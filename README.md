# Building a Machine Learning Model From Scratch

## Overview
I followed the [tutorial](https://github.com/Gaelim/PowerBI_Python_A_to_Z) from @Gaelim to practice build a machine learning (ML) model from scratch using Python and visualizing it with PowerBI. This model and dataset predicts the trends in profit from 50 startups.

### Description
This model 

### Objective
The objective of this project is to practice building ML models in order to incorporate it with a work project and predict machine performance in the enterprise. The goal is to predict when a machine starts to slow down in performance and when to switch the machine with a new machine.

### Languages and Techniques
* Python, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook, PowerBI
* Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

### Execution & Documentation
This project was written in Jupyter.
